# Airbnb Tableau Dashboard
This repository contains a Tableau dashboard that provides insights into Airbnb listings data.

## Overview

The dashboard consists of five main views:

1. **Average Price per Bedroom (Bar Graph):** This view displays the average price per bedroom across different listings, giving users an understanding of pricing trends based on bedroom count.

2. **Distinct Count of Bedroom Listings (Table):** Here, users can see a table showcasing the distinct count of listings based on the number of bedrooms they offer. This helps in understanding the distribution of listings by bedroom count.

3. **Price by Zipcode (Heatmap):** The heatmap view visualizes the price distribution across different zip codes, providing a geographical perspective on pricing variations.

4. **Price by Zipcode (Bar Graph):** This view complements the heatmap by presenting the same price data in a bar graph format, allowing for a different visualization of pricing trends across zip codes.

5. **Revenue for Year (Time Series):** Finally, the timeseries view tracks revenue trends over time, offering insights into seasonal patterns or overall revenue growth.
